\title{MA320 (Clontz) Writing Portfolio}
\author{Your name here}

\section{Writing Samples}
\textit{Include three examples of questions/answers
(not comments) you've posted to
\href{https://math.stackexchange.com/}
{Math.StackExchange} throughout the semester. For each, include
a citation to the post like \cite{1089984},
and be sure to make any necessary adjustments to
typeset your work in LaTeX. Among these, you must include one
question and one answer. You may answer your own question; these
count as separate examples.}

\textit{These posts should reflect
\href{https://usaonline.southalabama.edu/courses/35295/files/6197333?wrap=1}
{Prof. Su's Guidelines for Good Mathematical Writing}
and adhere to Math.SE's policies for
\href{https://math.stackexchange.com/help/asking}
{Asking}
and
\href{https://math.stackexchange.com/help/answering}
{Answering}. Be sure to have at least one example of mathematics
expressed as \LaTeX{} in each sample.}

\textit{For each sample, also provide a few sentences reflecting on it.
This should consider any scores/comments/answers received on your post,
but there is no specific requirement that your posts have any particular
score. Ultimately, was your question well-posed, or your answer useful?}

\item[[ ]] \textbf{Mathematics.} This portfolio engages in
mathematical concepts appropriate for a student enrolled in
MA320. In particular, these posts are generally concerned

\item[[ ]] \textbf{Reflection.} This portfolio includes
reflections for each post. Each post
is eiether a well-posed question or useful answer.
\item[[ ]] \LaTeX{}. This portfolio was properly typeset
using \LaTeX{}. In particular, mathmode (\verb|\(x^2\)|) was
used appropriately for mathematical expressions (\(x^2\))
in each post, and BibTeX \cite{bibtexDocs}
was used for reference management.
\end{itemize}


\section{Overall Quality}
\textit{Self-report your progress by marking the box [X] next to
